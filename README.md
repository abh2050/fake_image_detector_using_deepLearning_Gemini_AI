![AI Fake Detector Example](https://www.fakeimagedetector.com/static/images/image-forensics.jpg)

## Overview

The **AI Fake Image & Video Detector** is a powerful Streamlit-based application designed to identify whether images or videos are AI-generated or authentic. Utilizing advanced techniques, this tool helps detect synthetic media created by popular AI models such as DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and others.

## Features

The application integrates multiple sophisticated analysis techniques to determine authenticity:

- **Deep Learning Analysis**
- **Fourier Transform Analysis**
- **Error Level Analysis (ELA)**
- **Metadata Analysis**
- **Noise Pattern Analysis**
- **Compression Artifact Analysis**
- **Google Gemini AI Analysis** (optional)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abh2050/fake_image_detector_using_deepLearning_Gemini_AI.git
cd ai-fake-image-video-detector
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Setup Gemini API (Optional):**
- Obtain an API key from [Google Gemini](https://makersuite.google.com/).
- Create a `.env` file and add your API key:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Running the Application

Execute the following command:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Usage

- **Upload an image or video** in formats: `jpg, jpeg, png, bmp, tiff, webp, mp4, mov, avi, mkv, webm`
- Select preferred detection methods from the sidebar.
- Adjust the confidence threshold and frame analysis settings as needed.

## Detailed Breakdown: How It Works

The detector follows a multi-layered approach:

### 1. **Deep Learning Analysis**
A pretrained neural network evaluates the visual content to detect synthetic patterns and anomalies typical of AI-generated media.

### 2. **Fourier Transform Analysis**
The tool applies Fourier transforms to identify unusual frequency domain patterns common in artificially generated images, which differ significantly from natural photographs.

### 3. **Error Level Analysis (ELA)**
ELA reveals differences in compression levels throughout the image, highlighting potential alterations or synthetic regions by analyzing discrepancies caused by varying JPEG compressions.

### 4. **Metadata Analysis**
Analyzes EXIF metadata for suspicious software signatures, missing metadata, or indications that the media was generated by known AI tools.

### 5. **Noise Pattern Analysis**
Examines subtle noise patterns and inconsistencies, as AI-generated images typically contain distinct, unnatural noise characteristics compared to authentic images.

### 6. **Compression Artifact Analysis**
Evaluates compression artifacts and their uniformity across the image or video, as synthetic media often displays atypical artifact distributions.

### 7. **Google Gemini AI Analysis**
Uses Google's Gemini generative AI model to perform contextual analysis and textual inference, identifying signs of artificial generation from semantic clues and visual inconsistencies.

Upon completion, the application combines these analyses into an overall confidence score, providing a detailed verdict indicating whether the media is likely authentic or AI-generated.

## Example Usage

Upon uploading media, the app displays:
- A detailed analysis with confidence scores.
- Visualization of suspicious regions.
- Final verdict indicating likelihood of AI generation.

## Limitations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**
- No detection method guarantees 100% accuracy.
- Always use critical judgment in evaluating results.
